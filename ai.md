# AI Contributions

## Project Foundation

This project (PyKnife) was heavily designed, architected, and implemented with the assistance of AI tools, specifically:

- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** (Anthropic) - Used for initial project design, code implementation, test framework development, and documentation generation

The AI assistance helped with:
- Setting up the overall project structure
- Implementing the core functionality and command patterns
- Designing the test framework (including reference testing)
- Creating templates and helper scripts
- Generating comprehensive documentation

## Guidelines for Contributors

In the spirit of transparency, we ask that contributors follow these guidelines:

1. **Tag AI-assisted PRs**: If you use AI tools to help create or modify code for a pull request, please include information about which tools were used in your PR description.

2. **Format for AI disclosure**: Please use the following format:
   ```
   ## AI Assistance
   This PR was created with assistance from:
   - [AI Tool Name] - Used for [brief description of how it was used]
   ```

3. **Human review**: All code, whether AI-generated or not, should be carefully reviewed by a human before submission to ensure it meets the project standards and requirements.

## Why We Track AI Usage

We track AI tool usage to:
1. Maintain transparency about how the codebase is developed
2. Help understand and improve collaboration between humans and AI tools
3. Build a knowledge base about effective uses of AI in open source development

This is not meant to discourage the use of AI tools - on the contrary, we encourage the responsible use of AI to enhance productivity and code quality. We simply ask for transparency about these tools' involvement in the development process.

## AI Limitations

While AI tools are powerful assistants, they have limitations. Contributors should be aware that AI-generated code might:
- Contain subtle bugs or security issues
- Not always follow best practices
- Miss edge cases or important requirements

This is why human review and testing remain essential parts of the development process.

Thank you for your contributions to PyKnife, whether assisted by AI or not!
